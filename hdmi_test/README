Reversion History:
	2013/5/23:
	hdmi_test_v0.1:
        this project is based on the linux project which digilent provided,and i deleted
	the ip core such as the audio and the i2s ip which i would not use,and modified 
        the dts file,finally it can work!
        2013/5/26:
	In this version,i build the project scratchly,and i added the ip core axi_clkgen
        and axi_hdmi_tx_16b ip,and some ip which xilinx provided ,such as axi_vdma,in 
        this period,i have learned a lot and faced many problems, for example ,the clock	
        is very important to a design,originally i set the FCLK2 to 200 MHZ,but the ise
	implements it and its timing report is alerting me that the design can't meet 	
	the timing requirement,but i did't find this problem originally,and it takes me 	
	very very long time!
