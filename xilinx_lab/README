1.  Lab is based on xilinx provided for zedboard
2.  Maybe lab5 exists some error,first i followed the instruction in lab5,but when i do the step 9,
    it always tells me that AP is can't read,i closed the project and recreated a project ,but not
    correct it,so i copy the zynq_fsbl_0.elf and the other bin or elf to the workplace of XMD,
    in my computer ,the path is the 
    c:/users/jefby/AppData/Roming/Xilinx/PlanAhead,and it be ok.
3.  Maybe when you have written the Flash,you could close the project and power off the board,
    and follow my methods:
    a. open the xmd console
    b. connect arm hw
    c. ls
    d. in windows explore, copy the zynq_fsbl_0 to the XMD workplace (2 described)
    e. dow zynq_fsbl_0.elf
    f. others please refer the lab5 doc which xilinx provided
