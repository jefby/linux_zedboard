1. The project test_linux is based on the Linux Project Demo which Digilent provided,
   the original project is the ori,but the project is created from XPS, i changed it 
   to planahead,and it can successfully run.

2. trd_xilinx_14.4.rar is based on the trd project xilinx provided , and i changed it
   to zedboard,but Now there is something wrong with it,it can't drive the HDMI monitor,
   maybe because the clock frequency is too low! i will correct it in time.
